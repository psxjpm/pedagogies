# Co-constructing a NIME Performance Pedagogy

#### [Call for Short Position Papers \(Deadline: June 06, 2021\)](https://psxjpm.gitbook.io/pedagogies/call)

## Description <a id="description"></a>

In NIME 2018, Marquez-Borbon and Martinez Avila proposed a NIME performance pedagogy envisioning a holistic digital musical instrument \(DMI\) design approach which takes into account the ecosystemic aspects of communities of practice and the improvisatory and exploratory aspects of non-traditional pedagogical methods, in order to address the problem of DMI adoption and longevity \[1\]. As recently discussed within NIME, there is a need for developing pedagogies, repertoire, and critical discourse which attends to the long-term needs for sustaining prolonged musical practice within a performance community \(for example \[2, 3\]\).

This **online workshop** aims to start a conversation with members of the NIME community on how we may implement such pedagogies of performance practices with DMIs, by critically addressing existing epistemological and practical issues in NIME pedagogies, as well as by sharing and discussing existing pedagogical approaches among DMI designers, performers, practitioners, and pedagogues in the community. We also aim to ideate and generate new strategies together.

We are particularly interested in the implementation of non-traditional teaching strategies that formally structure both a non-hierarchical learning environment and non-prescriptive learning tasks in order to foster enactive and embodied learning processes, but we are open to discussing other pedagogical views in order to discuss, contrast and reflect on different ideas, strategies and approaches.

Hence, we encourage participants to [**submit proposals for short presentations**](https://psxjpm.gitbook.io/pedagogies/call) on their pedagogical approaches to teaching performance with DMIs, or to share their experiences developing performative techniques for their instrument, as well as their approaches for collaborative and improvisational practices with them, such as by engaging in jam sessions, developing notation or documenting their processes.

They may do so by showcasing their own DMIs or describing their experience practicing to perform with other people’s DMIs. Although it will not be compulsory to prepare a presentation or bring an instrument to attend to the workshop we expect that participants come prepared with ideas that they would like to discuss as well as to have previous experience as performers and designers of DMIs, or who teach others how to perform and design DMIs.

## Additional Speakers <a id="additional-speakers"></a>

**Lauren Hayes, Arizona State University**

Lauren Sarah Hayes is a Scottish musician and sound artist who builds and performs with hybrid analogue/digital instruments. She is a “positively ferocious improvisor” \(Cycling ‘74\), her music refusing to sit nicely between free improv, experimental pop, techno, and noise. Over the last decade she has developed and honed a deliberately challenging and unpredictable performance system that explores the relationships between bodies, sound, environments, and technology. The Wire described her most recent album MANIPULATION \(pan y rosas discos\) as “skittering melodies and clip-clopping rhythms suggesting a mischievous intelligence emerging from this web of wires”. She is a member of the New BBC Radiophonic Workshop.
