Workshop attendees are encouraged to submit a short position paper \(3000 words maximum, i.e. 1-2 pages\) using the [NIME Paper Proceedings Template ](https://github.com/psxjpm/pedagogies/raw/main/NIME_Submission_Templates.zip)and email their submission to the organisers of the workshops. The deadline for submission is Monday June 06, 2021 \(midnight your local time\). Papers will be publicly showcased in this space. For consistency we suggest you email us your submission as a PDF file including your author name and the abstract in the email's body. 

Participants will also be expected to present their papers at the workshop and then discuss it with other attendees during the breakout discussions. The duration of each presentation slot will depend on the number of submissions, but we are expected to have 1 hour of presentations. We will share a timetable with the line up of presentations.
